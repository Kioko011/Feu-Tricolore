# Feux-tricolores

This very simple project was carried out during the 2018 - 2019 school year to discover object-oriented programming.

## Goal

Initially, the aim was simply to create a traffic light where you can control the 3 available colours (Green, Orange, Red) thanks to a button on the side of it.

In a second step, it had to be automated so that the programme would change the colours of the traffic light by itself, leaving each colour for a certain number of seconds.
Unfortunately, I lost this part of the project.

## Building

Created with Visual Studio 2017 using Windows 7.
